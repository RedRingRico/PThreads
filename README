Overview

This repository is intended to demonstrate a variety of programs incorporating
PThreads for my own edification and hopefully they will prove useful to others.

Ideas for programs include:
* Loading a series of images from storage
* Simulating multiple AI Agents
* Client/Server simple game
* Update program that downloads files in the background, using callbacks to
  re-load updated assets
